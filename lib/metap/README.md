# metaP

A command palette-like helper I want to reuse in other projects.

This has grown out of other projects where I have added a `Meta P` command palette,
like [Garbuix](https://github.com/rberenguel/garbuix) or [nt](https://github.com/rberenguel/nt).

After implementing a similar, half-working one for the third time (Stardust) I decided to split it
off and make it more featureful.

It still needs some tests, because it's somewhat brittle and the code is long.

You can see it live [here](https://mostlymaths.net/metap/), press `Meta-P` (or `Ctrl-P`) to bring it up.

It is set to show a maximum of 3 commands out of 20. Arrows scroll, some commands accept inputs. They
are all placeholders though, they do nothing.
